modified many more
2013-01
since that was the only compile-ready script
i left this for authors
you can find it @ http://cgit.freedesktop.org/sound-theme-freedesktop 
so i've changed mostly .ogg files and makefile.am on stereo directory
and in this directory just changed few strings 
makefile.am 
index.theme.in 
configure.ac
and the ./po folder is without changes so thanks for that to authors of freedesktop install script

first start for me was here https://forums.mageia.org/en/viewtopic.php?t=4038
and here's the complete code https://github.com/SyMbiANtS/usual.art/

FREEDESKTOP SOUND THEME

LICENSES AND ORIGINS:
        See CREDITS

RULES:
        Similar to those defined by gnome-audio, quoting Elliot Lee:

        <snip>
                The criteria for sound inclusion:
                . No licensing issues
                  (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Good_Licenses)
                . Appropriate length
                        . Shorter than 1 second for any sound that denotes a specific event
                        . Shorter than 5 seconds for a background sound (basically, startup/shutdown)
                . Appropriate sound
                        . Volume
                        . Normalized between samples
                . Spectral range
                        . No extremes
                . Good taste
                        . KISS
                        . General common sense (hah!)
        </snip>

        Of course, in addition to this the Theming Spec not only requires
        normalized sounds, but those with with good perceived loudness as
        described in:
